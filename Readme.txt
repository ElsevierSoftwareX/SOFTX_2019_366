SCOUT: Signal Correction and Uncertainty Quantification Toolbox in MATLAB (v1.0)
================================================================================


Information
-------------------------
Author: Richard Semaan & Vikas Yadav
Affiliation: Technische Universität Braunschweig
Contact: r.semaan@tu-bs.de
Release date: Oct. 30, 2019
Version: v 1.0


Installation
-------------------------
- Graphical user interface version: Installing the GUI-version is straightforward, and follows the same steps as any MATLAB app. After downloading the file package, the user is required to go to APPS tab → Install App → Select SCOUT.mlappinstall → Open. What follows is an automatic installation that yields a SCOUT app in your list of MATLAB apps.
- Script version: The script-based version can be used as is. In other words, no installation is needed.


Features
-------------------------
This Matlab toolbox implements a range of signal post-processing and uncertainty analyses. The following techniques are available:

 - check and correct for stationarity
 - detect spurious samples
 - check for normality
 - check for periodicity
 - filter
 - perform spectral analysis
 - determine the integral time scale
 - perform uncertainty analysis on individual and on propagated signals through a data reduction equation.


Usage
-------------------------
Both SCOUT versions are located in the same folder as this Readme-file. The folder contains the following files:

 - License.txt
 - Readme.txt
 - 2019_JSS_Semaan.pdf: A reprint of a reference paper in Journal of Statistical Software detailing SCOUT
 - SCOUT_GUI: containing the installation App
 - SCOUT_Script: Containing 3 example scripts along with their corresponding configuration files and necessary data. The three examples can be used as tutorials to learn the different options and capabilities of SCOUT.
